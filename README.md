# Aldwicks Essentials
This is the repository for all the Delphi components I have created for use in the various application suites.

## ComboEditZaaz
This is exposes the CharCase property that for some reason is hidden in the base component TComboEdit

## ListViewZaaz
This exposes some properties of the TListView component, and further adds some new features and default stylings for the TSearchBox section of the component.

## ListViewZaazFilter
Building on **ListViewZaaz** this adds a TSpeedButton (FilterButton) with a TSkSVG component in the TSearchBar. It further exposes an event OnFilterButtonCLick that can be used when the user clicks the button.
